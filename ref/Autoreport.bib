	abstract = {We introduce a statistical model for microarray gene expression data that comprises data calibration, the quantification of differential expression, and the quantification of measurement error.
In particular, we derive a transformation h for intensity measurements, and a difference statistic Δh whose variance is approximately constant along the whole intensity range.
This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses.
For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x)=arsinh(a+bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for
microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing
transformations.
For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation,
and Δh with the log-ratio.
The parameters of h together with those of the calibration between experiments
are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estimation.
We demonstrate our approach on data sets from different experimental
platforms, including two-colour cDNA arrays and a series of
Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.Availability: Software is freely available for academic use as an R package at http://www.dkfz.de/abt0840/whuberContact: w.huber@dkfz.de},

	abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

	abstract = {The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by "batch effects," the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},
